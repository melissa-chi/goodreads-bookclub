# goodreads-bookclub 

This web tool (powered by Plotly Dash) will pull in Goodread users' to-read lists and find all the common books between them. If there are no books that are shared by the same users, then the books that are in the majority of lists will be returned. 

Best used for bookclubs/groups of readers trying to find their next read!

Instructions: 
1. Select the number of to-read lists that will be inputted. Note: If you change the number later on, you will have to re-enter all the URLs.
2. Enter the URL to each Goodreads' to-read list into each of the input boxes. (Click on your Profile -> Look for your Bookshelves -> Click 'to-read'). The URL should look something like https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/186644225?shelf=to-read. Your Goodreads profile must be PUBLIC. [Here are instructions to make your profile public](https://help.goodreads.com/s/article/How-do-I-edit-my-privacy-settings-1553870936907).
3. Click 'Submit' to get a list of books that all the lists have in common. If there are no books that overlap between all the lists, then books that appear in the majority of the lists will be returned. If there are no books that appear in the majority of the member's list, then no results will be returned.
4. Browse through the suggested books to find your next read!

Author's Note: As someone that is a part of many book clubs, it's always a hassle trying to find the next book for the club to read. I created this tool for me to easily see which books I have in common with other book club members! Hope you enjoy this tool.
